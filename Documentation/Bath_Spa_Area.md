# Bath Spa Area

Bath Spa is a major station on the main line between London and Bristol. While only having two platforms, the station sees up to 5 passenger services each direction per hour, as well as plenty of freight throughout the day.

## Simulation

A timetable for 23rd April 2025 has been included, running from 04:00 until about 01:30 the next morning. The standard off peak passenger service pattern is:

- 2tph London Paddington to Bristol Temple Meads (1tp2h extended to Weston-super-Mare)
- 1tph Portsmouth Harbour to Cardiff Central
- 1tph Salisbury to Bristol Temple Meads
- 1tp2h Weymouth to Gloucester
- 1tp2h Westbury to Gloucester
- 1tp2h Westbury to Swindon

Several additional peak services also run off-pattern, including a few in the morning peak which start at Bath Spa.

There are also plenty of freight services throughout the day.

## Operational Tips

- Keep an eye on the passing times at various junctions - trains may need to be held at red signals to wait for their correct slot.
- Sometimes freight trains can be routed early - but be careful not to delay passenger services as a result!
- Make sure to check the timetable details for each service carefully - which route does it need to take? Particularly for freight, the headcodes alone don't always indicate which direction they should go.
- Be careful not to set routes too far ahead at Bath Spa in the morning - some trains need to change direction here. Plan which platform they should use accordingly.
